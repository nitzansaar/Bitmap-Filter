## Description

This project is a command-line image filtering application developed as part of the CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course. The application allows users
to apply various image filters to input images, creating interesting visual effects.

## Features

- **Image Filtering:** Apply different filters to input images, including grayscale, blur, edge detection, and reflection.
- **File Input/Output:** Load images from files and save the filtered images to new files.
- **Command-Line Interface:** Use a command-line interface to specify the filter and input image file.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C code using your preferred compiler (e.g., clang, gcc).
3. Run the compiled program from the command line, providing the desired filter and input image file as arguments.

## What I Learned
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

Implementing image filtering algorithms in C.
Processing image files and pixel manipulation.
Command-line argument parsing and user input handling.
Debugging and testing C code
Gaining a deeper understanding of how image filters work and their applications in image processing.

## Usage

```bash
$ ./filter -g INFILE.bmp OUTFILE.bmp
